This details the feature selection process and methods used to begin training our data.

Part I: Feature Selection & Engineering
  1. Reducing categories
    a. Determine which categories are over 99% cross-correlated, and remove all but one of each set of highly
    cross-correlated categories from the dataset.
    b. Determine which categories have only 1 value, and remove those categories:
      recorded_by
    c. Determine which categories have no meaning, and remove those categories:
      num_private
    d. Determine which categories have little predictive power, and remove those categories:
      public_meeting
  2. Filling in zeros: Determine which categories have zero values where there shouldn't be zeros, and fill those in with averag
  values based on the context of that category. These averages may be calculated differently for different categories.
    a. construction_year: These zeros can be filled in using the average of all the non-zero elements in the category
    b. latitude, longitude, gps_height, and population: zeros can be filled using the average respective latitude or longitude within each district_code
    c. amount_tsh: 
    d. funder:
    e. installer fefefefawef
